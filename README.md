# AmqEnqueueTool
This is a simple tool created for Smarsh to enqueue item in ActiveMQ. Currently only Dev Zk configuration are added in App.config. Can be also used to QA and Prod environments, just providing appropriate MappingSetName, Queues and ConnectionUri. Need not to build this project separately for QA and Prod just can be change AmqEnqueueTool.exe.config :sunglasses:.
